          <ReusableText>The Story starts in 2019 with 13 year old shaad watching Logan Paul Vlogs and absolutely binging all his videos, being fascinated over the fact that he was able to cultivate such a cult like audience independently, with 0 support from anyone, he recorded himself, edited it himself, uploaded it on a FREE platform called youtube and voila millions of views.</ReusableText>

              But then I had started to get an idea that these big youtubers who make a shit ton of money each month, they are probably not sitting 12 hours each day editing their own videos, they probably pay their editors a lot of money as well!
